# Deep-learning-challenge

***Overview:*** The purpose of this module was to use various machine learning methods in predicting the chance of successfully getting funding for a new venture (not specified). The evaluation of each model's accuracy rates were first depended on the following process steps:

<ins>Data Processing:</ins>
* Target Variable:  Column labeled, Is_Successful: Noting 1 (Successful) and 0 (Failure). Labeled as y variable
* Feature Variables: Application type, Affiliation, Classfiication, use-case, organization, status, income_amount, special consideration, asking amount. Labeled as X, with the removed of the target variable
* Non useful variables: EIN & Name, since they are classficaition or identifying datapoints that does not need to go into the model

<ins>Model setup: Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model</ins>
There were three models that were tested manually through trial and error, along with a final tuner method. They are descibed below:

_Model 1:_
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? <br>

* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

_Model 2:_
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?


_Model 3:_
* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?



Tuner Method:

* How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
* Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
* What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
